every service will have own mongodb instance.

defatul port for mongo is 27017 so we use this number in yaml file.

steps to handle in auth service
- Does a user with this email already exist ? if so, respond with error
- Can't store passwords in plain text! Hash the password the user entered
- Create a new User and save them to mongoDB 
- User is now considered to be logged in. Send them a cookie/jwt/something

mongoose and typescript arent a good pairs. 
if we create a mongoose model and try to pass some other kinds of data to model typescript doesnt complain about it.
So we fix this problem by creating an interface with the required datas and create an function to return new model with the data implemented by the created interface.
if we fix it this way we have to export 2 things. to again fix it, we wanted to create like a build in method. We achieved it with adding statics property to the model.
but, Typescript didnt let us use build method just yet then we created an interface to give more information to typescipt.
which extend mongoose.Model and contains build method with the attribute types.

for the issue #2 
issue was when we create a model and console log it we could see extra values.
first we create another interface ( my understanding is we keep telling typescipt to what to show what we pass as a data, attributes etc.)
