Painful Things From App #1
- Lots of duplicated code!
- Really hard to picture the flow of events between services
- Really hard to remembet what properties an event should have
- Really hard to test some event flows
- My machine is getting laggy running kubernetes and everything else...
- what if someone created a comment after editing 5 others after editing a post while balancing on a tight rope...
