Ticketing Service Overview
- Create package.json, install deps
- Write Dockerfile
- Create index.ts to run project
- Build image, push to docker hub (don't push the image if you are using google cloud)
- Write k8s file for deployment, Service
- Update skaffol.yaml to do file sync for tickets
- Write k8s file for MongoDB deploymeny, service

!!! It needs to be super careful while writing k8s file because even the little indentation gives error !!!!!!!
One of the easy way to solve this issue (service is connected to the wrong MongoDB database) is to add in the URL to connect to as an environment variable.
