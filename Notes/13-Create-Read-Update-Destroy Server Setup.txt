Ticketing Service Overview
- Create package.json, install deps
- Write Dockerfile
- Create index.ts to run project
- Build image, push to docker hub (don't push the image if you are using google cloud)
- Write k8s file for deployment, Service
- Update skaffol.yaml to do file sync for tickets
- Write k8s file for MongoDB deploymeny, service

!!! It needs to be super careful while writing k8s file because even the little indentation gives error !!!!!!!
One of the easy way to solve this issue (service is connected to the wrong MongoDB database) is to add in the URL to connect to as an environment variable.

we get fail because of the global signin only works for auth service and we shouldnt make reuests to anything else inside of our application whatsoever under any circumstance.

As a reminder, your global signin declaration should look like this after the refactor:

declare global {
  var signin: () => string[];
}
One small fix is required to return the cookie to prevent our tests from failing:

Find the return of the global.signin method and change this:

  return [`express:sess=${base64}`];

to this:

  return [`session=${base64}`];

When we try to check if the ticket is not found and throw a custom error but we cant throw custom error because in error handler some different error is happening.
To debug it we can add console log to the error handler but then we have to make a patch for it because its a common package so here is the tricks:
It is not really recommended. you do this generally when you have no idea what is going on situations and you have to do some debugging without trying to change some dependency like common and have to redeploy.
we can add console .log to the file that is in the node_modules.
well because there is happening something that unpredictible in the error we should make an update for the common module.
