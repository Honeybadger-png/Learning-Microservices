Communication Strategies between services

Sync : Service communicate with each other using direct requests
Async : Services communicate with each other using events

Sync Communication: It is easy to use but there is still problems with dependency between services. If one crash it can effects the service.
Also the entire request is only as fast as the slowest request

Event Based Communication: request event send by event bus and the response data also created with event and send with event bus. Same problems in sync communication occur.
